# Ballin With Data | Codeology Spring 2020 Project

**Project Leaders: Calvin Chen, Matt Hashimoto**

**Project Developers: Trevor Baba, Ethan Chen, Katherine Peng, Krishna Ravi, John Um, Taylor Yoo**


# Background

Ballin with Data is a Data Science project by Matt Hashimoto and Calvin Chen, creating the ultimate NBA scout using ML. We got NCAA and NBA data from the `sportsreference` API (documentation [here](https://sportsreference.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)), and used ML models including Linear Regression, Neural Networks, K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, and Random Forests in order to project an NBA playerâ€™s rookie stat line based on their college stats. We then used the anvil webapp builder to create a UI to go along with our NBA Rookie Stat predictor, which was housed in a Jupyter Notebook.
