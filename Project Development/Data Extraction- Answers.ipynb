However, what may happen on different occassions is that you won't be able to find any reliable database/data source that has all the different components of the data you're looking for. When this happens, you need to be able to find the data yourself. **How would we go about doing that?

You've gotten all your data!** This is definitely not an easy task to do, so congratulate yourself with figuring out how `sportsreference` works and getting all the data we need for the project! Next week, we'll get into analyzing the different features of the data, and doing some [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis) and [feature engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering) to determine which features will be best to use for our project. Stay tuned for more :D"
